/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */

WITH caller_info AS(

solution 2:


/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */
SELECT ct.name as country 
	FROM calls c 
		 INNER JOIN Person p ON c.caller_id = p.id or c.callee_id=p.id 
		 INNER JOIN Country ct ON ct.country_code = substr(p.phone_number, 1, 3) 
	GROUP BY ct.name 
	HAVING avg(duration)  > (select avg(duration) FROM Calls);
